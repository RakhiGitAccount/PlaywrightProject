#Playwright Project


This is my first Playwright Sample Project

##Overview


This project will start a search from Google by using the keyword "playwright by testers talk". Then click on the URL and it will play the video on YouTube.
It will generate an HTML report and an Allure report for tests
I have used Playwright with Javascript to automate the tests in this project.
